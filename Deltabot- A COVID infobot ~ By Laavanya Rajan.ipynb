      "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Corona viruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.\n",
      "On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, â€œCOâ€ stands for corona, â€œVIâ€ for virus, and â€Dâ€ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as â€œ2019 novel coronavirusâ€ or â€œ2019-nCoV.â€\n",
      "The name \"coronavirus\" is derived from Latin corona, meaning \"crown\" or \"wreath\", itself a borrowing from Greek ÎºÎ¿ÏÏŽÎ½Î· korá¹“nÄ“, \"garland, wreath\".The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.\n",
      "The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America.\n",
      "Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.\n",
      "COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.\n",
      "COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.\n",
      "Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.\n",
      "A number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.\n",
      "Vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, although their effectiveness is limited. In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.\n",
      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.\n",
      "Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,cough, headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.\n",
      "During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\",with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus.In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID-19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID-19\" in public communications.\n",
      "Common symptoms include headache,loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time.\n",
      "COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.\n",
      "Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n",
      "Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.\n",
      "Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Some early studies suggest that ten to twenty percent of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.[263] About 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible expousure.As the deadly second wave of the coronavirus abates, paediatricians across India are reporting more cases of this rare but serious condition. Since doctors are still reporting cases, it is not clear how many children have been affected so far. Symptoms can often mimic other diseases at the start: high and persistent fever, rash, red eyes, inflamed lymph nodes, stomach pain, low blood pressure, body ache and lethargy.\n",
      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends parents should seek emergency care right away if their children show any of these warning signs or other concerning signs:\n",
      "Trouble breathing,Pain or pressure in the chest that does not go away,Inability to wake or stay awake,Pale, gray, or blue-coloured skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone,Severe abdominal pain.\n",
      "The rapid spread of the delta coronavirus variant has forced a growing number of countries to reimpose lockdowns and other public health restrictions, raising fears that the more contagious variant was hampering global efforts to contain the pandemic.\n",
      "Three scientific studies released on June 28 2021, offered fresh evidence that widely used vaccines will continue to protect people against the coronavirus for long periods, possibly for years, and can be adapted to fortify the immune system still further if needed.\n",
      "Most people immunized with the mRNA vaccines may not need boosters, one study found, so long as the virus and its variants do not evolve much beyond their current forms â€” which is not guaranteed. Mix-and-match vaccination shows promise, a second study found, and booster shots of one widely used vaccine, if they are required, greatly enhance immunity, according to a third report.\n",
      "Older adults, people with weak immune systems and those who take drugs that suppress immunity nonetheless may need boosters. But people who survived Covid-19 and were later immunized may never need additional shots, because their immune responses seem to be particularly powerful.\n",
      "COVAXIN India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).\n",
      "The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.It is a 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart.\n",
      "It is a vaccine with no sub-zero storage, no reconstitution requirement, and ready to use liquid presentation in multi-dose vials, stable at 2-8oC.\n",
      "COVAXIN is Supplied from government to government in the following countries to take place: Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Bahrain, Oman, Maldives and Mauritius.\n",
      "India is home to the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India. It has long churned out more vaccine doses by volume than any other company, even before the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "The vaccines available in India are:-Covishield, Covaxin, Zydus Cadilla, Covovax, Corbevax, HGCO19 and Sputnik V\n",
      "All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria has said making vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) available for children would be a \"milestone achievement,\" as concerns persist over the impact of a potential third Covid-19 wave on those under the age of 18, including children.\n",
      "Availability of Covid-19 vaccine for children would pave the way for the reopening of schools and outdoor activities. Schools have to be reopened as there has been a major loss in studies in the last 18 months due to the pandemic.\n",
      "While experts are near unanimous that a third wave of Covid-19 would hit India in the near future, they are divided over its impact on kids. While some say that this age group would be the most vulnerable.\n",
      "Currently, every Indian citizen above the age of 18 is eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine shot. \n",
      "Vaccination is very much important to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",
      "Vccination is a must.\n",
      "You should Vaccinate...\n",
      "Vaccination is definitely good.\n",
      "Vaccination reduces the chances on contracting the virus again, so it is of atmost importance.\n",
      "Serum Institute developed Covishield. Adar Poonawala is the CEO of SII. Head Quarters of SII is Pune.\n",
      "You need to follow Government guidelines for the vaccination drive.\n",
      "The government had said in May that earlier this year, it had ordered a total of 356 million doses of the two vaccines to be available for use up until July, but not all of these doses had been delivered.\n",
      "Active coronavirus cases in India as on 29 June is 5,52,660.\n",
      "Total COVID-19 cases in India as on 29 June is 3,03,16,897.\n",

      "USA is the country with most COVID-19 cases as on 29 June 2021.\n",
      "The disease affects the lungs predominantly.\n",
      "It is expected that the country will face a third wave by September.\n",
      "Worldâ€™s first DNA-plasmid vaccine is by Zydus-Cadilla and it is made in India.\n",
      "HGCO19 is Indiaâ€™s first mRNA vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Genova in collaboration with Seattle-based HDT Biotech Corporation.\n",
      "Only 4% of Indian population has been vaccinated as of June 29 2021. India has administered a total of 323,663,297 doses as on June 29 2021.\n",
      "ICMR said that the third wave of coronavirus could be delayed until December this year.\n",
      "The number of average daily cases in India has fallen to just over 50,000 in recent days, down from the peaks of 400,000 in May. The drop in numbers has largely been attributed to strict lockdowns by states.\n",
      "Crowding in markets, election rallies and religious festivals was blamed for the second wave. Bad policy decisions, poor surveillance and ignoring early warnings were some of the other reasons. If the same mistakes are repeated, experts say, that could hasten the third wave.\n",
      "The Delta variant of the coronavirus largely drove the second wave.\n",
      "The Delta Plus Variant or Delta-AY 1 is the sub lineage of the Delta variant, that originated in India. The Indian government has announced that a new variant, named Delta plus, is a \"variant of concern\". The Delta Plus variant is the mutated form of the Delta variant, earlier found in India. The Delta variant has so far been found in 85 countries.\n",
      "Vaccination and safety measures such as wearing of face masks are essential when it comes to fighting the Delta Plus coronavirus variant.\n",
      "The Delta Plus Variant spreads almost 60 per cent faster than its predecessor, the Delta variant. It also binds more easily to the lung cells and shows higher resistance to some of the drugs being used against Covid-19.\n",
      "Some of the symptoms of Delta Plus Variant COVID-19 includes cough, diarrhoea, fever, headache, skin rash, discolouration of fingers and toes, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n",
      "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area.\n",
      "Continue taking care of your health and wellness\n",
      "Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.\n",

      "Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any underlying medical condition that requires immediate attention.\n",
      "Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n",
      "Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n",
      "Clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces. You may choose to also disinfect depending on certain conditions or everyday practices required by your home. To disinfect, most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered household disinfect ants will work. See CDCâ€™s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.\n",
      "Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home \n",
      "Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.\n",
      "If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts so that they can quarantine at home and get tested.\n",
      "Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).\n",
      "The person who is sick should isolate. Learn when and how to isolate.\n",
      "Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.\n",
      "If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n",
      "The person who is sick should wear a mask when they are around other people at home. They do not need to wear a mask if they are alone.\n",
      "Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.\n",
      "The best way to protect yourself and others is to quarantine by staying home for 14 days if you think youâ€™ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. Check your local health departmentâ€™s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.\n",
      "Be alert for symptoms of COVID-19.\n",
      "If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.\n",
      "You may NOT need to quarantine if:You have been fully vaccinated and have no symptoms or You were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last three months and donâ€™t develop any new symptoms\n",
      "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (â€œasymptomaticâ€). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n",
      "People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms â€“ from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.\n",
      "Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases.\n",
      "Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by:-Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested, Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19\n",
      "During contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for: Money, Social Security number, Bank account information, Salary information and Credit card numbers\n",
      "A person is still considered a close contact even if one or both people wore a mask when they were together.\n",
      "Masks work best when everyone wears one. However, masks are not 100% effective at preventing spread of COVID-19, and the type of masks used and whether or not they are used consistently and correctly varies throughout the general population. Therefore, mask use is not considered when determining whether someone is a close contact during case investigation and contact tracing.\n",
      "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.\n",
      "However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, itâ€™s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.\n",
      "Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. See If You Have Pets for more information about pets and COVID-19.\n",
      "However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâ€™s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.\n",
      "Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts you at higher risk for COVID-19.\n",
      "Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible.\n",
      "If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.\n",
      "Cover coughs and sneezes\n",
      "If you are wearing a mask: You canâ€¯cough or sneeze into your mask. Put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands.\n",

      "Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.\n",
      "Throw used tissues in the trash.\n",
      "Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n",
      "Currently there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 by eating or handling food.\n",
      "It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, such as a food package or dining ware that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Follow food safety guidelines when handling and cleaning fresh produce. Do not wash produce with soap, bleach, sanitizer, alcohol, disinfectant or any other chemical.\n",
      "There is also no current evidence that people can get COVID-19 by drinking water. The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or kill the virus that causes COVID-19.â€‹\n",

      "corona viruses are a group of related rna viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.\n",
      "in humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.\n",
      "mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19.\n",
      "on february 11, 2020 the world health organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, first identified in wuhan china.\n",
      "the new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as covid-19.\n",
      "in covid-19, â€œcoâ€ stands for corona, â€œviâ€ for virus, and â€dâ€ for disease.\n",
      "formerly, this disease was referred to as â€œ2019 novel coronavirusâ€ or â€œ2019-ncov.â€\n",
      "the name \"coronavirus\" is derived from latin corona, meaning \"crown\" or \"wreath\", itself a borrowing from greek îºî¿ïïžî½î· korá¹“nä“, \"garland, wreath\".the name was coined by june almeida and david tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.\n",
      "the earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in north america.\n",
      "coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor.\n",
      "some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as mers-cov, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).the human coronavirus discovered in 2003, sars-cov, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.\n",
      "covid-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet).\n",
      "people who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others.\n",
      "cases of reinfection with covid-19  have been reported but are rare.\n",
      "we are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.\n",
      "covid-19 spreads very easily from person to person.\n",
      "how easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary.\n",
      "the virus that causes covid-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.\n",
      "six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.\n",
      "a number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus sars-cov-2.\n",
      "antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins.\n",
      "drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.\n",
      "vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses ibv, tgev, and canine cov, although their effectiveness is limited.\n",

      "at least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.\n",
      "during the initial outbreak in wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"wuhan coronavirus\",with the disease sometimes called \"wuhan pneumonia\".in the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the spanish flu,middle east respiratory syndrome, and zika virus.in january 2020, the who recommended 2019-ncov and 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g.\n",

      "common symptoms include headache,loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.people with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time.\n",
      "covid-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.along with laboratory testing, chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.\n",
      "preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n",
      "social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals.\n",
      "methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.\n",
      "individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.\n",
      "self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.\n",
      "health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.some early studies suggest that ten to twenty percent of people with covid-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.\n",
      "a majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.\n",
      "[263] about 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.\n",
      "the strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.those who may have been exposed to someone with covid-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible expousure.as the deadly second wave of the coronavirus abates, paediatricians across india are reporting more cases of this rare but serious condition.\n",
      "since doctors are still reporting cases, it is not clear how many children have been affected so far.\n",

      "three scientific studies released on june 28 2021, offered fresh evidence that widely used vaccines will continue to protect people against the coronavirus for long periods, possibly for years, and can be adapted to fortify the immune system still further if needed.\n",
      "most people immunized with the mrna vaccines may not need boosters, one study found, so long as the virus and its variants do not evolve much beyond their current forms â€” which is not guaranteed.\n",
      "mix-and-match vaccination shows promise, a second study found, and booster shots of one widely used vaccine, if they are required, greatly enhance immunity, according to a third report.\n",
      "older adults, people with weak immune systems and those who take drugs that suppress immunity nonetheless may need boosters.\n",

      "coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.\n",
      "although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging.\n",
      "however, it may be possible that people can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n",
      "handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.\n",
      "wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.\n",
      "if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n",
      "clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.\n",
      "cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces.\n",
      "you may choose to also disinfect depending on certain conditions or everyday practices required by your home.\n",
      "to disinfect, most common environmental protection agency-registered household disinfect ants will work.\n",
      "see cdcâ€™s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.\n",
      "most people who get covid-19 will be able to recover at home \n",
      "stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.\n",
      "if you have covid-19, tell your close contacts so that they can quarantine at home and get tested.\n",
      "use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).\n",
      "the person who is sick should isolate.\n",
      "learn when and how to isolate.\n",
      "wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.\n",
      "if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n",
      "always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n",
      "the person who is sick should wear a mask when they are around other people at home.\n",
      "they do not need to wear a mask if they are alone.\n",
      "clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.\n",
      "the best way to protect yourself and others is to quarantine by staying home for 14 days if you think youâ€™ve been exposed to someone who has covid-19.\n",
      "check your local health departmentâ€™s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.\n",
      "be alert for symptoms of covid-19.\n",
      "if possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from covid-19.\n",
      "you may not need to quarantine if:you have been fully vaccinated and have no symptoms or you were previously diagnosed with covid-19 within the last three months and donâ€™t develop any new symptoms\n",
      "children can be infected with the virus that causes covid-19 and can get sick with covid-19.\n",
      "most children with covid-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (â€œasymptomaticâ€).\n",
      "fewer children have been sick with covid-19 compared to adults.\n",
      "babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from covid-19.\n",
      "some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to covid-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (mis-c).\n",
      "people with covid-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms â€“ from mild symptoms to severe illness.\n",
      "symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.\n",
      "if you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have covid-19.\n",
      "contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases.\n",
      "contact tracing slows the spread of covid-19 by:-letting people know they may have been exposed to covid-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of covid-19, helping people who may have been exposed to covid-19 get tested, asking people to self-isolate if they have covid-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with covid-19\n",
      "during contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for: money, social security number, bank account information, salary information and credit card numbers\n",
      "a person is still considered a close contact even if one or both people wore a mask when they were together.\n",
      "masks work best when everyone wears one.\n",
      "however, masks are not 100% effective at preventing spread of covid-19, and the type of masks used and whether or not they are used consistently and correctly varies throughout the general population.\n",
      "therefore, mask use is not considered when determining whether someone is a close contact during case investigation and contact tracing.\n",
      "although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes covid-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.\n",
      "however, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, itâ€™s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.\n",
      "based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading covid-19 to people is considered to be low.\n",
      "see if you have pets for more information about pets and covid-19.\n",
      "however, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâ€™s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.\n",
      "being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts you at higher risk for covid-19.\n",
      "avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible.\n",
      "if indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.\n",
      "cover coughs and sneezes\n",
      "if you are wearing a mask: you canâ€¯cough or sneeze into your mask.\n",
      "put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands.\n",
      "if you are not wearing a mask:\n",
      "always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.\n",
      "throw used tissues in the trash.\n",
      "immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n",
      "if soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n",
      "currently there is no evidence that people can get covid-19 by eating or handling food.\n",
      "it may be possible that people can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object, such as a food package or dining ware that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.\n",
      "however, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n",
      "follow food safety guidelines when handling and cleaning fresh produce.\n",
      "do not wash produce with soap, bleach, sanitizer, alcohol, disinfectant or any other chemical.\n",
      "there is also no current evidence that people can get covid-19 by drinking water.\n",
      "the covid-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water.\n",
      "conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or kill the virus that causes covid-19.â€‹\n"
